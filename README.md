# duplicate-question-identification

## Dataset
The [Quora Question Pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs) dataset is used in this paper.

For a proper comparison to the published S-BERT models, the accompanying dataset splits were also used. These can be found [here](https://sbert.net/datasets/quora-IR-dataset.zip). The splits used are in the `classification`  within the zip file, and should be placed in the `data/sbert/` directory of this project.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Python dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them by running the following command from the `src` directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
